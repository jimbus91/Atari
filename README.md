This is a script written in Python that trains an artificial intelligence (AI) agent to play the game Ms. Pac-Man. It uses a Q-learning algorithm to learn how to play the game by observing its own actions and the resulting rewards. The agent starts by randomly initializing its Q-table, which stores the expected reward for each state-action combination. During the training process, the agent selects actions based on a combination of its current Q-values and a random exploration rate. After each action, the agent updates its Q-values based on the observed reward and the maximum expected reward from the next state. The training process is repeated for a fixed number of episodes, and the Q-table is saved every 500 episodes. Finally, the total reward for each episode is printed to show the agent's performance.
